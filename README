This is the source code to my old IRC bot known as snackb0t. A lot of the
code is less than optimal.

It's lacking a lot of core functionality that should have been coded long
ago like access control, so it isn't recommended to run this code base
as-is.

It used jdbc-postgresql and a hardcoded table layout for a backend. It
expects to find a settings file in the same directory as the jar file with
the following format:
network=
port=
ident=
identpassword=
dbpath=jdbc:postgresql://path/to/database
dbuser=
dbpass=
channels=#foo,#bar,#etc
OS=
Contact=
